## Background

DWPprovides the catalog section with tile framework for studio pages (custom pages). This framework allows for many layout options such as cards, color theme, and number of cards to be displayed. You can specify the color theme (light or dark), and whether the cards have a drop shadow. Additionally, you can set the tile size in catalog sections as compact, default, or large to suit the page layout.

The following image is an example of how catalog sections appear after configuring the tile framework:
