## Define functions with the question responses to auto-populate the questionnaire fields

This capability is available with the![DWP Advanced icon.png](.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_DWP-Advanced-icon.png)DWP[license](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Planning/License-types-and-features/).

Define functions within a questionnaire that act on user answers. These functions can apply operations on the responses to compute values, fill in fields, and enforce logic before the submission of service requests. This enhancement creates a smarter and more responsive questionnaire that adapts in real-time based on user input, offering the following benefits:

* **Faster form completion**—Auto-filled and computed fields reduce manual typing and guesswork, reducing cognitive load.
* **Enforced business rules**—Prevents non-compliant submissions at the source, such as a refund exceeding the allowance amount.
* **Reduced errors**—Built-in logic prevents mistakes that could delay the processing of a service request.

For more information, see[Applying operations to question responses](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Building-service-catalogs/Creating-service-questionnaires/Applying-operations-to-question-responses/).

## *(Controlled availability)*Use HelixGPT to make services easily requestable via chat

This capability is available with the[Service Management service](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Helix-Common-Services/Other/BMC-Helix-Subscriber-Information/helixsubscriber/BMC-Helix-services/BMC-Helix-Service-Management-service/)as described in Subscriber Information.

Catalog administrators can save their time and manual efforts by using HelixGPT to make services easily accessible and requestable via chat. End users can request such services via Employee navigator.

Using HelixGPT provides the following benefits to the catalog administrators:

* Save manual efforts required for using the Publish chat-enabled servicewizard to make services requestable.
* Avoid human errors when using disambiguation, providing variations in service descriptions, service clarification phrases, and providing natural language variations of the questions.
* Achieve faster scalability by making several services requestable in a short period of time.
* Improve discoverability of services that help users identify the appropriate service for their queries.

For more information, see[Using HelixGPT to make services requestable via chat](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Using-BMC-HelixGPT-to-make-services-requestable-via-chat/).

## Use the delivery estimate to define service timelines

Catalog administrators can specify a value in the**Delivery Estimate**field to show how long a service usually takes to complete. The**Delivery Estimate**field replaces the older**Provisioning Time**field. In**Service Broker context data type**, the**Turnaround Date**field uses the delivery estimate instead of the provisioning time. Administrators can turn on the**Show to requestors**option to display the estimate as “Typically takes” on the service catalog and checkout pages.

This capability offers the following benefits:

* Users can see how long a service might take without contacting Support.
* Users can decide when to request a service based on how long it usually takes.

For more information, see[Setting service level agreements](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/wiki/internal/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/dwpMaster2/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Building-service-catalogs/Adding-and-updating-services/Setting-service-level-agreements/).
