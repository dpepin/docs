TheDWP Catalogis a consumer-like storefront for end users to find knowledge articles, services delivered internally or by third-party vendors, and context services such as location.

As a Catalog administrator, you can configure the catalog to include services from different lines of business, design the services and their workflows, create virtual marketplaces to entitle services to a group of authorized users, and so on.

DWP Catalog empowers catalog administrators to create services with minimal effort with the HelixGPT-powered Service Catalog Curator.

## Scenario: Request a bundle of services to onboard new employees

A bundle is a group of related services that end users can request with a single click. The bundle request is fulfilledby calling the workflows for individual services one at a time.

Britney is being onboarded to Apex Global as a full time employee, who will be working from home. As part of her onboarding process, she submits the*Home office setup*request bundle to receive IT assets and office equipment. This bundle includes the following services:

* Request IT assets - To receive standard IT assets such as a laptop, backpack, external monitor, wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, and a headset.
* Request office equipment - To receive an office chair and a laptop stand. Britney also opts for optional equipment such as a footrest and a file of drawers.

Instead of submitting multiple requests, Britney submitted a bundle of services.

## Scenario: Quick in-person assistance for a faulty device

Newman, an employee of a large accounting company, typically works remotely. He travels frequently in his role and requires the use of a mobile hotspot device. The accounting company has recently switched carriers and assigned everyone new hotspot devices, but Newman cannot connect for more than a few minutes at a time.

Rather than wait for a new device or go through another phone call with his IT team, Newman launches his DWP application and schedules an in-person Help Desk appointment. He schedules the appointment for next Monday, when he will be visiting the corporate headquarters on other business.

When his appointment time arrives, Newman brings the device in. Having read the problem description in Newman's ticket, the IT employee behind the desk tries a few troubleshooting tactics with Newman's device and determines that the problem is caused by a hardware failure. The IT employee exchanges the faulty device for a new one and configures it on the spot. Newman tests it to his satisfaction and tells the IT employee that the ticket can be marked as resolved. The entire interaction takes 15 minutes.
