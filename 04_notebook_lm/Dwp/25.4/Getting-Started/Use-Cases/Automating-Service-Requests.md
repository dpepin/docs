Automating routine and repetitive tasks increases the efficiency of your service desk because it frees up your service agents to focus on strategic initiatives and unique requests that need manual intervention. Service automationreduces the risk of human error,decreases resolution time, brings efficiency, ensures security and compliance, reduces administrative burden, and improves user experience.Password resets, software provisioning requests,access management, and employee onboarding requests are a few examples of tasks that can be automated.

## Automated service creation with the Service Catalog Curator AI agent

As a catalog administrator, use Service Catalog Curator, an AI agent powered by HelixGPT, to automate the catalog service creation process. Enter prompts and necessary inputs for the service you want to create, review the summary, make real-time edits, and get the service automatically created in Draft state. This AI tool empowers catalog administrators by providing a solid foundation for generating catalog services, saving time and manual effort. For more information, see[Leveraging Service Catalog Curator for creating services](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Leveraging-Service-Catalog-Curator-for-creating-services/).

After the catalog service is created, you can automate the catalog service tasks. For more information, refer to the following documentation.

## Typical request fulfillment automation process

You can use an automation tool such as Intelligent Automation or any third-party tool to automate manual tasks involved in request fulfillment.

An automated fulfillment workflow includes the following steps:

1. A user submits a request in DWP.
2. The fulfillment workflow creates a work order or a ticket inITSM.
3. ITSMsends the incident information to the automation tool.
4. The automation workflow in the tool performs the steps to fulfill the work order.
5. The tool informs the user.
6. It updates the work order or ticket and resolves it.
