As an administrator, you can accelerate self-service for end users by providing them with knowledge articles, products, and services from multiple lines of business such as IT, HR, and Facilities. You can deploy these self-service resources for end users anytime, anywhere, and on any device of their choice.

Self-service resources reduce the burden on your support teams while empowering end users to resolve their issues independently.
