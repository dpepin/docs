### Create knowledge articles from incidents by using the Knowledge Curator AI agent for faster incident resolution

As a service desk agent, create knowledge articles from incidents directly in HKM by using the Knowledge Curator AI Agent.

This capability provides the following benefits:

* Users need not navigate away from the incident to create a knowledge article.
* Incident data, such as description, summary, and work notes is used to generate the knowledge article.
* The knowledge article is automatically pinned to the incident for ready reference.

![Create a new knowledge article](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_253_CreateAKnowledgeArticle.png)

Learn more about how to create knowledge articles by using the Knowledge Curator agent in ITSM in[Creating knowledge articles from incidents by using Knowledge Curator](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-ITSM/itsm254/Getting-started/Use-cases/Create-knowledge-articles-from-incidents-by-using-Knowledge-Curator/).

### Use the Service Collaborator AI agent to automatically send email responses for inbound emails

As an administrator, enable automatic responses to inbound emails by using the Service Collaborator AI Agent. The AI agent understands the incident and sends an appropriate response to the email. The response contains a summary of the information retrieved from published knowledge articles with recommended resolutions for the incident. If users find the response helpful, they can resolve the incident directly by clicking**Resolve**button in the email body.

This capability provides the following benefits:

* Reduces agent workload by automating routine email responses.
* Improves response time and user satisfaction with faster, accurate replies.
* Increases operational efficiency by allowing agents to focus on complex issues while Service Collaborator handles common queries.

![Automatic email received for an incident created by an inbound email](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_253_AutomaticEmailResponseExample.png)

Learn more about enabling automatic responses to inbound emails in[Enabling automatic responses to inbound emails by using Agentic AI](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-ITSM/itsm254/Setting-up-and-going-live/Configuring-settings-to-use-Agentic-AI-capabilities/Enabling-automatic-responses-to-inbound-emails-using-Agentic-AI/).

### *(Controlled availability customers only)*Preview and edit HKM knowledge articles directly within ITSM

As a Service Desk Agent, preview and edit knowledge articles from HKM directly within the ITSM interface.

This capability provides the following benefits:

* No need to navigate away from the ITSM application to preview and edit the knowledge articles from HKM, streamlining workflows and saving time.
* Experience a seamless user interaction of viewing and editing knowledge articles from both sources with easy navigation.
* Use similar editing capabilities for the knowledge articles from both sources.

![Preview BMC Helix Knowledge Management by ComAround knowledge article in an incident](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_25_3_HKM-ITSM_PreviewArticle.png)

### Use the enhanced Agentic Chat to search for incidents, change requests, and knowledge articles

As a Service Desk Agent, use Agentic Chat for an improved, conversational experience when searching for incidents, change requests, and information from knowledge articles.

The improved chat provides the following benefits:

* When an administrator enables HelixGPT for ITSM, Agentic chat is available out of the box. The administrator need not enable it separately.
* A user can retrieve similar and related incidents in the chat and access incidents, change requests, and person objects directly from the chat through inline links.

### Use predefined prompts in Ask HelixGPT to accelerate incident resolution and improve response consistency

As a service desk agent, use predefined prompts in Ask HelixGPT to minimize manual entry of standard queries and accelerate incident resolution. An administrator can also modify the predefined prompts according to the business requirement.

This capability provides the following benefits:

* Ease of use and improved user interaction, resulting in faster resolution of incidents.
* Customization of predefined prompts according to business requirements.

![what's_new_ask_helixgpt.jpg](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_what%27s_new_ask_helixgpt.jpg)

### Use auto ticket categorization for accelerated incident resolution by leveraging AI capabilities

As a Service Desk Manager, leverage the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze historical, closed incidents to classify incoming incidents into appropriate categories. AI also predicts the best-suited support group for resolving incidents.

This AI-based capability provides the following benefits:

* Better classification of incidents into categories, resulting in quicker resolutions.
* Improved assignments to support groups, ensuring appropriate utilization of support resources.

![1751436769641-472.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_1751436769641-472.png)

### Use contextual search in the Contracts console filters

As a user, leverage the type-ahead search in filters in the Contracts console to get contextual suggestions for search criteria such as email ID and department. Suggestions appear after you enter the first three characters.

This capability provides the following benefits:

* Alignment with other ITSM consoles, delivering a consistent, intuitive user experience across consoles.
* Service desk agents require less training to work on multiple consoles, improving productivity.

![1751436562517-981.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_1751436562517-981.png)

Learn more about the Contract console in[Managing contracts through the Contracts console](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/wiki/internal/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/assetMaster2/Managing-contracts/Managing-contracts-through-the-Contract-console/).

### Create a contract from an asset or another contract

As an asset manager, create a contract from an asset or a contract ticket and relate it without navigating away from the ticket. You can also associate existing contracts with assets**.**This capability is consistent with Mid Tier and reduces the repetitive steps, saving you time and effort in asset management.

![1751436700906-571.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_1751436700906-571.png)

### Detect major incidents by using additional qualifiers

As a Service Desk Manager, get recommendations to assess whether an incident candidate qualifies to be classified as a major incident. This assessment is based on advanced major incident qualifiers such as economic impact, data loss, and reputational impact.

This capability provides the following benefits:

* Use the recommendation to identify major incidents and their risks in advance to reduce the impact of major incidents.
* Improve the overall incident management in your organization.

![1751436728750-750.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_1751436728750-750.png)

Learn how to detect major incidents in[Managing major incidents](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/wiki/internal/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/sdMaster2/Managing-incident-requests/Managing-and-tracking-major-incidents/).

### *(Controlled availability customers only)*Localize foundation data to meet locale-specific language requirements

Localize the foundation data in the supported languages to enable users to view it in their preferred language while maintaining language consistency with the application user interface.

Localizing the foundation data helps you adhere to the region-specific language compliance requirements and also enhances user experience.

For more information, see[Localizing foundation data into the supported languages](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-ITSM/itsm254/Administering/Localizing-foundation-data-into-the-supported-languages/).

### Enhanced localization support

![Record Definitions Creation using Ask HelixGPT.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_Record-Definitions-Creation-using-Ask-HelixGPT.png)

## Enhance the flexibility of the Record editor by binding inputs to view variables instead of record fields

As an application business analyst, you can create a view variable while designing a view to get more flexibility while managing data. You can bind a supported Record editor input to this variable instead of binding it to a record field. The value of the view variable can be used within the view. The changes to a variable will be reflected in the input that is bound to it. Conversely, the changes in the input will be reflected in the view variable to which this input is bound. For more information, see[Creating or modifying view definitions](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is253/Tailoring-applications-and-automating-processes/Creating-the-definitions-for-a-tailorable-application/Defining-the-user-interface-through-view-definitions/Creating-or-modifying-view-definitions/).

* Enhances automation by leveraging AI capabilities within workflows.
* Retrieves responses dynamically based on user input.
* Integrates conversational experiences seamlessly into business workflows.

For more information, see[Invoking an AI agent from the process](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is253/Tailoring-applications-and-automating-processes/Creating-the-definitions-for-a-tailorable-application/Defining-the-application-business-logic-through-processes/Invoking-an-AI-agent-from-the-process/).

![25_3_Invoke_Agent_Element.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_25_3_Invoke_Agent_Element.png)

## Enable localization of data in AR System forms

As an administrator, enable data localization so that users across multiple regions can interact with IS in their preferred language. With support for localized data, users benefit from improved clarity, compliance, and a more intuitive experience. Administrators can easily manage localized data, ensuring consistency and accessibility across the organization.

For more information, see[Preparing your application to be localized](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is253/Developing-applications-by-using-Developer-Studio/Localizing-an-application-to-other-languages/Using-the-localization-toolkit-to-localize-your-applications/Preparing-your-application-to-be-localized/).

![Localizable data.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_Localizable-data.png)

## Create advanced search filters by combining AND, OR, and NOT operators

While creating search filters for HKM articles, administrators can define advanced search filters that integrate logical operators AND, OR, and NOT within a single query. When your end users use these filters to search for knowledge articles, the workplace page returns only those articles that meet the search criteria. This capability helps users in the following ways:

* Delivers the most relevant knowledge articles.
* Reduces time spent sifting through unrelated search results.
* Helps users apply the right solutions to the right context.

For more information, see[Creating search filters for applications](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is253/Enabling-services/Configuring-BMC-Helix-Knowledge-Management-by-ComAround-as-a-knowledge-provider/Creating-search-filters-for-BMC-applications/).

![HKM adv filter small.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.3-enhancements-and-patches_HKM-adv-filter-small.png)

## *(Controlled availability customers only)*Preview and edit HKM knowledge articles directly within ITSM

Knowledge workers can preview and edit knowledge articles from HKM directly within the ITSM interface.

Knowledge workers can benefit from a seamless and consistent experience when viewing and editing knowledge articles from HKM. They don't need to navigate away from the ITSM application to preview or edit the knowledge articles from HKM, streamlining workflows and saving time.

![ShowResultList_PV.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_ShowResultList_PV.png)

## Date/Time fields can store values beyond January 19, 2038

Date/Time fields can support values beyond January 19, 2038, up to April 11, 2262, which helps store future dates, such as End of Life (EOL) dates for assets. Earlier, Date/Time fields did not support values later than January 19, 2038, because the database column used the INT data type.  
For more information, see[Date and time fields](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Developing-applications-by-using-Developer-Studio/Developing-the-application-interface/Creating-and-managing-fields/Data-fields/Types-of-data-fields/#Typesofdatafields-Dateandtimefields)and[Troubleshooting invalid or truncated dates.](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Developing-an-API-program/AR-System-Java-API-overview/Programming-with-the-Java-API/Troubleshooting-the-Java-API/Troubleshooting-invalid-or-truncated-dates/)  
  
For Oracle, this capability is supported automatically after you upgrade to IS 25.4.  
For MSSQL, this capability is supported only for fresh deployments.  
For PostgreSQL, after upgrading to IS 25.4, you must run a database migration to update the data type of the Date/Time field column from INT to BIGINT.​​​​​ To perform the migration, submit a Change Request (RFC) in[Support Central](https://www.bmc.com/support/support-central.html). For more information, see the[Request for Change process](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Helix-Common-Services/Other/BMC-Helix-Subscriber-Information/helixsubscriber/Policies/BMC-Helix-Change-Management-policy/Request-for-Change-process/).

![icon_play.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_icon_play.png)[Watch the video that describes the new features in CMDB 25.4](https://youtu.be/ZALhErG3jqg)

### Improved RE performance with Java-based miscellaneous service

The delete, purge, copy, and compare activities in the Reconciliation Engine run in a dedicated Java-based miscellaneous service. This enhancement improves the performance and reliability of the reconciliation engine by separating these activities from the main reconciliation pod. For more information, see[Enabling or disabling reconciliation engine services](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-CMDB/ac254/Using/Merging-duplicate-CIs-by-reconciling-data-from-multiple-sources/Creating-a-reconciliation-job/Reconciling-a-large-number-of-CIs/).![Delete purge.png](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_Delete-purge.png)

### Manage product data collection from within the product

You can now manage your product data collection preferences directly from the**Analytics**option in CMDB. This enhancement provides greater control by allowing you to enable or disable data collection from within the product, without navigating to another console. The data helps improve product performance, identify usage trends, and prioritize feature enhancements.  
For more information, see[Modifying consent for data collection](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-CMDB/ac254/Administering/Modifying-consent-for-data-collection/).![Analytics](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_Analytics2.png)

### Date and Time fields support dates beyond the year 2038

CMDB Date and Time fields support dates beyond January 19, 2038, helping you store long-range timelines like End of Life (EOL) for configuration items (CIs). With this enhancement, the Date and Time field can store values up to April 11, 2262, 11:47:16.854 PM. This change ensures accurate tracking of future lifecycle data in CMDB.  
For more information, see[Normalization and the Product Catalog](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-CMDB/ac254/Using/Managing-consistency-of-CMDB-data-by-using-normalization/Normalization-and-the-Product-Catalog/).![Date/Time Support](Release-Notes-And-Notices/.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_Date.png)

### What else changed in this release​

The following table lists the changes in the product behavior:

| Update | Product behavior in versions earlier than 25.4.00 | Product behavior in version 25.4.00 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Failover support for CMDB to Smartgraph synchronization for Telco Extensions | If a CMDB to Smartgraph synchronization run failed or if the AR or plug-in server experienced a temporary outage, the entire sync process had to be restarted. | During the sync, if temporary outages or failures occur, the sync automatically resumes from the point of interruption instead of restarting the entire process. This failover mechanism prevents data duplication, minimizes delays, and maintains consistency across synchronized records.For details, see[Syncing CIs for Telco Extensions by using SmartGraph Sync](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-CMDB/ac254/Administering/Scheduling-a-DSM-Sync-to-share-impact-attributes-with-BMC-Helix-NetOps/). |

announces the end-of-life plan for Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT) forITSMandIS. We recommend that you plan to transition to Dashboards for your reporting needs.

**Important**

While every effort is made to provide accurate, forward-looking guidance on product direction to assist you with your buying and planning decisions, cannot guarantee that intentions stated as follows are final and binding.

[Support-information](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-ITSM/itsm254/Troubleshooting/Support-information/)

[Deprecated-and-discontinued-features](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-ITSM/itsm254/Release-notes-and-notices/Deprecated-and-discontinued-features/)

## Background

BIRT is a module ofITSM, (earlier known as Remedy IT Service Management Suite) and delivers in-application ITSM reporting capabilities as a part of the standard ITSM user licenses. You might have used BIRT to develop reports and dashboards forITSMapplications or applications created by using IS.

## Statement of direction

Starting with version 25.4.00, plans the end of life of BIRT in ITSM applications and applications developed by using IS.

To view and create reports, recommends that all customers use Dashboards or shared consoles in ITSM. Dashboards offers a unified reporting and dashboard experience across all service and operations management solutions.

To help you with a smooth transition to Dashboards, we plan to deliver relevant documentation and videos that explain the deployment of Dashboards.

**Important**

Dashboards does not deliver a one-to-one replacement for all BIRT features.

## Transition period

will use the following timelines to complete the transition:

* Starting with version 25.2.00, users can no longer create new web reports. However, they can continue to edit and access existing reports. To create new reports, they must use Dashboards.
* From version 25.3.00, users can no longer print reports by using the Print button from ticket forms. However, they can continue to print the reports from the report console.
* Starting with version 25.4.00, support for all BIRT reports will end.

You can continue using BIRT reports to view and edit existing reports until you upgrade to version 25.4.00; you cannot create new reports. However, support will no longer be available for BIRT reports.

Starting with version 23.3, we have streamlined the documentation of ITSM to help you find the documentation for the ticket types that you work on.

## Why was the change?

Prior to version 23.3, information related to Mid Tier and Smart IT for the same ticket type was in different documentation spaces. For example, if you work on Incident Management, you had to go through two different documentation spaces to get the required information - one for Mid Tier and one for Smart IT and PWA screens. Going forward, you will be able to find all information related to a*specific*ticket type, for example Incident Management, in one single documentation space. Similarly, all information related to Change Management is in the Change Management documentation space.

Due to the redesigned documentation, you get the following advantages:

* Reduced topic-hierarchy: Get to the content with fewer clicks.
* Use-case based titles: Easier to find the topic you are looking for.
* Merged topics: Less number of topics to navigate through, all relevant information is in the same topic.

The following video (3:15) provides an overview of documentation space restructure from ITSM version 23.3.

## Structure within a topic

At a topic level, we have segregated the information so that it is easier for you to follow the latest information. Based on your requirement, you can also read information related to older screens in the same topic. For example, if you are reading about a procedure that can be performed by using PWA screens, classic Smart IT, and Mid Tier, the topic will display the information related to the PWA screens at the top. If you want, you can read the relevant information for the classic interfaces (Classic Smart IT and Mid Tier) by going to the**Instructions for classic interfaces**section of the topic.
