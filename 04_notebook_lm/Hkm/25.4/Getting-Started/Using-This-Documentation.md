## To select another version of the product

When you find documentation from a search engine, such as a Google search, you might be looking at documentation for  
an older version of the product.

1. Open a topic in the product documentation.
2. In the**Product version**section in the navigation pane, click the version number.
3. From the list of product documentation versions, select the required version.![version-selector.png](.attachments/Using-this-documentation_version-selector.png)

   After you select the required version from the list, the same topic opens if it's available in the selected version. If the topic is not available or has a different title, you are directed to the homepage of the selected version. You can then search for the specific content.
4. Alternatively, use the breadcrumb to view the content of the page in the other versions.

## To view sections on a page

The**On this page**pane in the product documentation typically serves as a table of contents for the current documentation page. It is beneficial on long pages with multiple sections, such as prerequisites, steps, examples, and troubleshooting.

1. On the right side of the page, you see the**On this page**section, which lists all major headings on the page.
2. Click a heading to jump to the specific part of the page without scrolling.
