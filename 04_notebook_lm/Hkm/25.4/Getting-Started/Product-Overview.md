HKM is an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered, cloud-based knowledge management software that can be used for a centralized way of work with knowledge. You can create, search, and access valuable knowledge across multiple cloud data sources to ensure delivery of the right information for the best resolution.

HKM can used as a[knowledge provider for applications](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Knowledge-Management-by-ComAround/hkm/Getting-started/Use-cases/Leveraging-knowledge-articles-from-BMC-Helix-Knowledge-Management-by-ComAround-in-other-BMC-applications/)or it can be integrated with third-party applications[by using REST APIs](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Knowledge-Management-by-ComAround/hkm/Integrating-with-third-party-applications-by-using-the-REST-API/).

HKM provides HKM Knowledge, HKM Self Service, and Knowledge vNext interfaces that you can use to administer the configurations, and create and search for knowledge articles. To learn more about the interfaces and typical use cases associated with them, see[User interface overview](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Knowledge-Management-by-ComAround/hkm/Getting-started/User-interface-overview/).

## Success stories

|  | The story<br> | References<br> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Electrolux - Higher self-service usage and reduced service call rates<br> | To overcome their challenge of spending time and money on translating knowledge articles into several languages for their Global market, Electrolux chose HKM and in just two months, managed to implement one customized, self-service knowledge base with content in 34 languages. The solution is fully integrated into more than 80 Electrolux websites, and the company now has one knowledge base for all 30 worldwide locations.<br> | For more information, see[Electrolux customer story](https://www.bmc.com/customers/electrolux.html).<br> |
| Volvo - Higher resolution rate and increased customer satisfaction<br> | The Volvo Customer Care Center's biggest challenge was the wide variety of questions they received about their products. Implementing HKM helped Volvo create structured, easy-to-use, and intuitive knowledge that did not require any training before using it. With the use of HKM, the Customer Care Center has seen an increased customer satisfaction through their Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI), increased resolution rate, and increased competence of the customer care agents across all channels - phone, emails, chat, and social media.<br>Watch the following video (1:44) to learn about a success story of Volvo Cars Sweden from a first-hand account.<br>[🎥 Watch Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEjXQ8xPdSI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEjXQ8xPdSI)<br>![icon-play.png](.attachments/Product-overview_icon-play.png)<https://youtu.be/vEjXQ8xPdSI><br> | You can also read more at[Volvo customer success case study](https://www.bmc.com/documents/case-study/customer-care-center-at-volvo-car-sweden.html).<br> |
