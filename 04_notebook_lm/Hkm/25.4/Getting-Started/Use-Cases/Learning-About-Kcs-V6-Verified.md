HKM was KCS v6 verified in 2018. The verification guarantees an efficient knowledge management workflow and advanced data capabilities to enable reporting and follow-up. The[KCS Academy](https://www.thekcsacademy.net/), in partnership with members from the[Consortium for Service Innovation](https://www.serviceinnovation.org/)developed the minimum functional criteria and scenarios through which vendors demonstrate their software application's ability to support the latest version of the KCS practices.
