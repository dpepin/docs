In Developer Studio, create a Progressive Web Application (PWA) by creating the components of the application interface such as fields, forms, and workflows in a Progressive View.

## Before you begin

You must enable Progressive View for forms by using the Centralized Configuration. To know more, see[Enabling Progressive Views for forms from the Centralized Configuration](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Developing-Progressive-Web-Applications/Enabling-Progressive-Views-for-forms-by-using-Centralized-Configuration-Settings/).

## To create a Progressive View in Developer Studio to create Progressive Web Applications

1. In Developer Studio, create a New Regular Form.
2. Create a Progressive View.

   <details class="confluence-expand-macro panel panel-default"><summary><span class="panel-title"><span class="title-text">Steps (2)</span></span></summary><div class="panel-body"><ol><li>Select<strong>Form &gt; Create New View</strong>.<br/>The Create New View dialog box opens.</li><li>In the<strong>View Type</strong>list, select<strong>Progressive</strong>.<br/><img alt="image2021-2-18_11-11-57.png" data-xwiki-translated-attribute-thumbnail="true" height="103" src="../.attachments/Creating-a-Progressive-View-in-Developer-Studio_image2021-2-18_11-11-57.png"/><br/><br/></li></ol></div></details>

The Progressive View appears with panel holders having the following colors and the tooltip at the view tab is suffixed with "Progressive".
