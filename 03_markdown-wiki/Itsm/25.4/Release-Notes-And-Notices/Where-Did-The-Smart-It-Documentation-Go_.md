Starting with version 23.3, we have streamlined the documentation of ITSM to help you find the documentation for the ticket types that you work on.

## Why was the change?

Prior to version 23.3, information related to Mid Tier and Smart IT for the same ticket type was in different documentation spaces. For example, if you work on Incident Management, you had to go through two different documentation spaces to get the required information - one for Mid Tier and one for Smart IT and PWA screens. Going forward, you will be able to find all information related to a*specific*ticket type, for example Incident Management, in one single documentation space. Similarly, all information related to Change Management is in the Change Management documentation space.

Due to the redesigned documentation, you get the following advantages:

* Reduced topic-hierarchy: Get to the content with fewer clicks.
* Use-case based titles: Easier to find the topic you are looking for.
* Merged topics: Less number of topics to navigate through, all relevant information is in the same topic.

## Structure within a topic

At a topic level, we have segregated the information so that it is easier for you to follow the latest information. Based on your requirement, you can also read information related to older screens in the same topic. For example, if you are reading about a procedure that can be performed by using PWA screens, classic Smart IT, and Mid Tier, the topic will display the information related to the PWA screens at the top. If you want, you can read the relevant information for the classic interfaces (Classic Smart IT and Mid Tier) by going to the**Instructions for classic interfaces**section of the topic.
