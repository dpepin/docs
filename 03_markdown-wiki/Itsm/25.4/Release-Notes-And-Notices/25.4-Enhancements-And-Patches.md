![Catalan.png](.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_Catalan.png)

## Enable archiving on audit records

As an application business analyst, you can create an association between a parent record and its corresponding audit record. This association ensures that the parent record is archived with the related audit record, facilitating complete and consistent archival.

For more information, see[Creating record associations](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Tailoring-applications-and-automating-processes/Creating-the-definitions-for-a-tailorable-application/Defining-record-definitions-to-store-and-manage-data/Creating-record-associations/).

![Create_association.png](.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_Create_association.png)

## Launch Dashboards from the AR System Report Console to manage reports

With BIRT reports reaching end of life, administrators can use alternative, modern tools to view analytics for various artifacts and print the reports. Reports are now accessible via Dashboards, PWA screens, or other ITSM consoles. These tools ensure continued access to critical data with enhanced visualization, export, and printing capabilities.

When you view the BIRT reports, a message is displayed in the application informing you about the end of life of the reports.

For more information, see[Creating and managing reports from the AR System Report Console](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Using/Reporting-on-Service-Management-application-activity/Creating-and-managing-reports-from-the-AR-System-Report-Console/).

![ShowResultList_PV.png](.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_ShowResultList_PV.png)

## Date/Time fields can store values beyond January 19, 2038

Date/Time fields can support values beyond January 19, 2038, up to April 11, 2262, which helps store future dates, such as End of Life (EOL) dates for assets. Earlier, Date/Time fields did not support values later than January 19, 2038, because the database column used the INT data type.  
For more information, see[Date and time fields](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Developing-applications-by-using-Developer-Studio/Developing-the-application-interface/Creating-and-managing-fields/Data-fields/Types-of-data-fields/#Typesofdatafields-Dateandtimefields)and[Troubleshooting invalid or truncated dates.](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Developing-an-API-program/AR-System-Java-API-overview/Programming-with-the-Java-API/Troubleshooting-the-Java-API/Troubleshooting-invalid-or-truncated-dates/)  
  
For Oracle, this capability is supported automatically after you upgrade to IS 25.4.  
For MSSQL, this capability is supported only for fresh deployments.  
For PostgreSQL, after upgrading to IS 25.4, you must run a database migration to update the data type of the Date/Time field column from INT to BIGINT.​​​​​ To perform the migration, submit a Change Request (RFC) in[Support Central](https://www.bmc.com/support/support-central.html). For more information, see the[Request for Change process](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Helix-Common-Services/Other/BMC-Helix-Subscriber-Information/helixsubscriber/Policies/BMC-Helix-Change-Management-policy/Request-for-Change-process/).

## Improve AR System server startup time by usage-based loading of forms

As an administrator, you can improve AR System server startup time by configuring usage-based loading of the forms in the cache. This configuration analyzes the most frequently used forms during AR System server startup and loads only the necessary forms to minimize the server's load. Configure the AR System server to run a periodic removal check to identify forms that have been idle for longer than the defined time. Remove the forms that are not frequently used.

For more information, see[Improving AR Server startup time by usage based loading of forms](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Administering/Monitoring-the-system-and-performance/Configuring-cache-settings-for-AR-System/Improving-the-AR-Server-startup-time-by-loading-forms-based-on-their-usage/).

## Configure support group and assignee fields for cases

Use the Change Assignment component in the View designer to define fields for the support group and assignee in Business Workflows. These fields appear as drop-downs on the case screen, helping agents select appropriate assignments during case updates.

For more information, see[Updating case assignments using the Change Assignment component](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Innovation-Suite/BMC-Helix-Innovation-Suite/is254/Tailoring-applications-and-automating-processes/Creating-the-definitions-for-a-tailorable-application/Defining-the-user-interface-through-view-definitions/Changing-assignments-using-Change-Assignment-component/).

### Improved RE performance with Java-based miscellaneous service

The delete, purge, copy, and compare activities in the Reconciliation Engine run in a dedicated Java-based miscellaneous service. This enhancement improves the performance and reliability of the reconciliation engine by separating these activities from the main reconciliation pod. For more information, see[Enabling or disabling reconciliation engine services](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-CMDB/ac254/Using/Merging-duplicate-CIs-by-reconciling-data-from-multiple-sources/Creating-a-reconciliation-job/Reconciling-a-large-number-of-CIs/).![Delete purge.png](.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_Delete-purge.png)

### Manage product data collection from within the product

You can now manage your product data collection preferences directly from the**Analytics**option in CMDB. This enhancement provides greater control by allowing you to enable or disable data collection from within the product, without navigating to another console. The data helps improve product performance, identify usage trends, and prioritize feature enhancements.  
For more information, see[Modifying consent for data collection](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-CMDB/ac254/Administering/Modifying-consent-for-data-collection/).![Analytics](.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_Analytics2.png)

### Date and Time fields support dates beyond the year 2038

CMDB Date and Time fields support dates beyond January 19, 2038, helping you store long-range timelines like End of Life (EOL) for configuration items (CIs). With this enhancement, the Date and Time field can store values up to April 11, 2262, 11:47:16.854 PM. This change ensures accurate tracking of future lifecycle data in CMDB.  
For more information, see[Normalization and the Product Catalog](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-CMDB/ac254/Using/Managing-consistency-of-CMDB-data-by-using-normalization/Normalization-and-the-Product-Catalog/).![Date/Time Support](.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_Date.png)

### What else changed in this release​

The following table lists the changes in the product behavior:

| Update | Product behavior in versions earlier than 25.4.00 | Product behavior in version 25.4.00 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Failover support for CMDB to Smartgraph synchronization for Telco Extensions | If a CMDB to Smartgraph synchronization run failed or if the AR or plug-in server experienced a temporary outage, the entire sync process had to be restarted. | During the sync, if temporary outages or failures occur, the sync automatically resumes from the point of interruption instead of restarting the entire process. This failover mechanism prevents data duplication, minimizes delays, and maintains consistency across synchronized records.For details, see[Syncing CIs for Telco Extensions by using SmartGraph Sync](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/IT-Service-Management/BMC-Helix-CMDB/ac254/Administering/Scheduling-a-DSM-Sync-to-share-impact-attributes-with-BMC-Helix-NetOps/). |
