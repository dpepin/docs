HelixGPT enables users to request services directly through chat conversations in Virtual Agent and DWP. Administrators can make services requestable via chat by using the following methods:

* Importing services created in DWP Catalog into HelixGPT by using the Publish wizard.
* Using the Catalog Request Agent. Learn more about this agent in[Using HelixGPT to make services requestable via chat](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Using-BMC-HelixGPT-to-make-services-requestable-via-chat/).

Both methods allow users to interact with these services conversationally. These services typically include a set of questions that users answer in the chat to complete a request.

**Important**  
These best practices apply to chat-enabled services that administrators have made requestable via chat. They do not apply to catalog services that are not chat-enabled and are instead presented to users as clickable links in the Employee Navigator chat. For more information about suggesting services as clickable links, see[Using Employee Navigator to find AI-generated answers](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Using-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace-to-request-services/Using-Employee-Navigator-to-find-AI-generated-answers/).

To ensure services are both discoverable and usable through HelixGPT, we recommend that you design services with conversational AI in mind. Services designed for visual interfaces might not translate well to AI-based conversational experiences. Traditionally, services that are meant to be requested via the application UI greatly rely on structured forms and questions with predefined logic. To guide users through a decision path, they ask a broad category question like*Software*or*Hardware*, then narrow down to options like*Laptop*or*Mobile*.

In contrast, HelixGPT aims to understand the user's intent with fewer questions. Therefore, creating simple and focused services can enhance usability and user experience in HelixGPT.

## Best practices for different user roles

Different user roles contribute to optimizing services for HelixGPT. The following table outlines best practices for each role:

| Role | Goal | Best practices | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DWP Catalog administrator | Define and structure services to ensure that they suit well for HelixGPT.<br>These best practices apply to services made available in chat by using either the Publish wizard or the Catalog Request Agent.<br> | Create smaller, purpose-driven servicesthat are easier to prompt and maintain.<br>Avoid bundling multiple requests, such as a laptop, Wi-Fi, and accessories, into a single catalog item.

| Use clear and precise titles for catalog services.<br>Ensure each service title is descriptive and unambiguous. Descriptive titles help HelixGPT to quickly identify the requested service.<br> |
| Create unique titles for your services to improve accuracy in recognizing the user's intent.<br>Avoid similar service titles. If multiple services have similar names, HelixGPT might confuse them.<br> |
| Aim for clear, user-friendly language that is easily understood by a broad audience and is easier for HelixGPT to interpret.<br>Avoid using overly technical terms or internal jargon in service descriptions.<br> |
| Limit the number of questions because too many questions can affect chat performance and user experience.

| When you create a questionnaire, consider the following question types that HelixGPT doesn't support in chat:<br>  * Table * Question with an option value whose length is greater than 64 * Conditional questions * Questionnaire actions in service * Lookup queries using filter expressions that refer to questions or fields that are populated with the process variable of the Service Broker Context data type (sbContext).  Additionally, consider chat limitations related to the following fields:<br>  * Text area—Supports only plain text and does not allow rich text formatting. * Attachment— Supports attaching only one file to each question in HelixGPT-powered Employee Navigator.  **Important:**This limitation applies specifically to services imported into HelixGPT by using the Publish wizard.*(Controlled availability)*For details on unsupported question types when using the Catalog Request Agent, see[Using HelixGPT to make services requestable via chat](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Using-BMC-HelixGPT-to-make-services-requestable-via-chat/).<br> | [Importing chat-enabled services from DWP into HelixGPT](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Virtual-Agent/hva253/Integrating/Importing-chat-enabled-services-from-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace-Advanced-into-BMC-HelixGPT/) |
