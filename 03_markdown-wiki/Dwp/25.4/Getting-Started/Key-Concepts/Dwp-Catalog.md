## Enriched catalog profiles

Enhance the service catalog experience by creating profiles for service items that include:

* Multimedia carousel of videos and images to illustrate the selected service.
* Rich text descriptions with business and technical details to help users make decisions when requesting services.
* Downloadable files and links to internet and other web resources.

## Rich text formatting

Users can benefit from the text editing interface when they submit comments to service requests.

**Important**

* For services created directly inDWP Catalog, end users can add rich text formatting in comments and answers to a questionnaire.
* Rich text format is supported in approvals of onlyDWP Catalogrequests andBusiness Workflowscases.

The following text customization options are available:

* Bold, Italic, and Underline fonts
* Color selection
* Text alignment
* Hyperlinks
* Numbered and bulleted lists
* Formatting options for copy-and-pasted text
* Attachment icon and drag-and-drop capability for file upload
* Drag-and-resize capability to resize images within the text fields
* URI schemes  
  To learn more about the supported URI schemes, see[Updating-the-attachment-settings-and-URI-schemes](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Administering/Administering-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/Updating-the-attachment-settings-and-URI-schemes/).

Comments with rich text formatting added in DWP are supported and retained byBusiness Workflows. These comments can be seen in request details inDWP Catalogand are preserved in email notifications.

However, inITSM, comments are shown as plain text, and inserted images are shown as attachments.

As a catalog administrator, you can also enable end users to leverage rich text formatting in questionnaires. To learn more, see[Adding-questions-to-a-questionnaire](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Building-service-catalogs/Creating-service-questionnaires/Adding-questions-to-a-questionnaire/).

Notify users of important information and draw attention to featured services in your catalog by using promotional banners of different sizes.You create these banners inDWP Catalogandadd them to the catalog display in the DWP Admin console The banner is then visible to the end users in the end-user console.

The following image is an example of a full-width hero banner displayed in the end user console:

## Catalog service bundles

Help users select options for requested items. Service bundles can contain optional items that the user can switch on or off before submitting the request. The catalog manager can can control which optional items are included when packaging a bundle.

The following image is an example of a bundle with optional items:

## Catalog search

Make it easier for users to find items in the catalog. Users can search the catalog for words found in the following catalog profile sections:

* Service name or title
* Service version
* Service description
* Service tags

**Best practice**  
We recommend that you develop a consistent tagging scheme for your organization.

## Satisfaction surveys

Enable organizations to collect user feedback by configuring post-request surveys for completed catalog service requests. Surveys can be customized with rating scales like CSAT or NPS, adaptable templates, and adjustable delivery frequency options. With this capability, catalog administrators can monitor service performance, measure customer satisfaction, analyze user sentiment, and encourage continuous improvements.

For more information, see[Setting up satisfaction surveys for catalog services](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Setting-up-surveys/Setting-up-satisfaction-surveys-for-catalog-services/).
