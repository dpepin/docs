## Guide users to a resolution by clarifying their ambiguous asks

This capability is available with the[Service Management service](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Helix-Common-Services/Other/BMC-Helix-Subscriber-Information/helixsubscriber/BMC-Helix-services/BMC-Helix-Service-Management-service/)as described in Subscriber Information.

Configure the Employee Navigator Supervisor agent, which uses built-in tools and coordinates sub-agents, to simplify the service interactions for employees. This agentic AI configuration transforms the Employee Navigator chat into a dynamic, more human-like, and context-aware experience in the following ways:

* Asks users follow-up questions to better understand the user intent when the initial input is vague.
* Responds by retrieving information from various sources, such as knowledge articles, service requests, approvals, To-dos, or service health items.
* Provides relevant catalog service links or guides users through a questionnaire to submit requests via chat.
* Connects users to live support or offers a generic request link when no resolution path is available.

For more information, see[Configuring Employee Navigator Supervisor agent](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Administering/Administering-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/Configuring-Employee-Navigator-Supervisor-agent/).

## Submit catalog requests through guided conversations

As an end user, submit service requests via the Employee Navigator chat through an interactive conversational experience. The agent interprets your query, identifies the most relevant catalog service, and walks you through the questionnaire. This capability provides the following benefits:

* Provides continuity by offering links to catalog services when chat-supported services are not available.
* Reduces manual effort and streamlines the process by submitting requests via chat.
* Improves the findability of services through AI-driven matching.

To learn more about the Catalog Request Agent, which facilitates this capability, see[Configuring Employee Navigator Supervisor Agent](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Administering/Administering-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/Configuring-Employee-Navigator-Supervisor-agent/)and[Using HelixGPT to make services requestable via chat](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Using-BMC-HelixGPT-to-make-services-requestable-via-chat/).

## Access Employee Navigator via Microsoft Teams for a seamless experience

This capability is available with the[Service Management service](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Helix-Common-Services/Other/BMC-Helix-Subscriber-Information/helixsubscriber/BMC-Helix-services/BMC-Helix-Service-Management-service/)as described in Subscriber Information.

Access Employee Navigator within the Microsoft Teams interface to perform service management tasks. End users can ask their workplace queries and track service requests without leaving the communication environment they use every day. They save time and stay focused, reducing friction in daily workflows.

To learn more about Microsoft Teams integration, see[Configuring Employee Navigator in the Microsoft Teams chat](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Administering/Administering-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/Configuring-Employee-Navigator-in-the-Microsoft-Teams-chat/).

## Set up service level targets for service requests

The SLM Service library on Helix Platform enables catalog administrators to define, track, and display service targets for DWP requests. Implementing this feature brings several advantages to administrators, agents, and end users:

* Enhanced reporting with real-time SLM status in service request dashboards
* Streamlined configuration by using reusable service targets across catalog items
* Better SLA compliance tracking with milestone-based status updates
* Automated notifications for milestone alerts via email
* Seamless upgrade path from legacy provisioning time to delivery estimates

For more information, see[Configuring Service Level Management](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/wiki/internal/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/dwpMaster2/Administering/Administering-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace-Catalog/Configuring-Service-Level-Management/#)

## Measure user satisfaction with the NPS survey

This capability is available with the![DWP Advanced icon.png](.attachments/25.4-enhancements-and-patches_DWP%2520Advanced%2520icon.png)DWP[license](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/wiki/internal/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/dwpMaster2/Planning/License-types-and-features/).

Provide catalog administrators with the ability to configure surveys by using the Net Promoter Score (NPS) method as an alternative to the existing CSAT formats. This enhancement benefits organizations in the following ways:

* Aligns with industry-standard metrics for customer sentiment.
* Facilitates clear differentiation of survey data by using scale types like CSAT and NPS.
* Allows customization of rating labels to better reflect organizational terminology and support localization.
* Automatically updates the survey template during global scale changes.
* Supports seamless integration of survey data with the Catalog reports that reflect survey scales.

For more information, see[Designing custom surveys for catalog services](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Creating-and-managing-the-service-catalog/Setting-up-surveys/Setting-up-satisfaction-surveys-for-catalog-services/Designing-custom-surveys-for-catalog-services/).

## Evaluating Customer Satisfaction via the DWP Net Promoter Score Dashboard

Use the DWP Net Promoter Score Report dashboard to evaluate customer satisfaction by analyzing survey responses and ratings from the customer service cases based on the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who rate 0–6) from the percentage of promoters (those who rate 9–10) on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (lowest value) to 10 (highest value).

For more information, see[Viewing DWP dashboards](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Administering/Administering-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/Viewing-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace-dashboards/)

## Configure a welcome message to guide users in Employee Navigator

Configure a welcome message to be displayed when an end user starts a new topic in Employee Navigator. The message provides a brief introduction and helps you get started with Employee Navigator quickly.

You can also configure the message to be displayed in any of the supported localized languages.

For more information, see[Configuring HelixGPT in the end-user console and studio pages](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/dwp254/Administering/Administering-BMC-Helix-Digital-Workplace/Configuring-BMC-HelixGPT-in-the-end-user-console-and-studio-pages/).

## *(Controlled availability)*Embed the Employee Navigator chat panel in your website

As a website developer, embed the Employee Navigator chat panel in your website to bring Employee Navigator capabilities directly to your users. End users can interact with the panel to receive intelligent, context-aware assistance wherever they are. The interface and functionality of the embedded panel closely match the experience end users already have with Employee Navigator in DWP.
